# My Day To-Do - Document sharing system

This is a simple document sharing system similar to Google Drive. The content upload will not be limited to documents
hence each document, hence the class name Asset in the model folder. In this system a user will be able to upload and
track multiple assets.

> **_NOTE:_**  User roles and permissions will be be a part of the MVP.

# Objective
The goal is to gain an understanding of the complexity of creating a document sharing system and provide code samples 
for anyone looking to create a system like this. Once fully developed a user will be able to, 
- Create an account and login via basic authentication
- Upload assets (e.g. documents)
- View all the assets uploaded
- Share the assets with other users

> **_NOTE:_** at this stage, it will either be a full REST API or depending on time, may have simple UI


# Hosting
This app will be hosted on an powered by AWS infrastructure.
